# PPTP2019

Currently, this demo puts the player in control of the camera in a small scene with three static objects.

The game tracks what objects are on screen and how long they are on screen for. 

If the player presses the F key, the position of each object on screen vis-a-vis a 3x3 grid is printed to the console (e.g. "Blue is in the top left").

If the player presses the G key, the relative positions of each object to each other on the Y axis are printed to the console (e.g "Red is higher than Blue. Red is higher than Orange. Blue is higher than Orange").
